The repo only has svgs for the ying color scheme, but all color schemes have zipped pngs in the [Releases](https://github.com/Mynotaurus/Yingmotes/releases) section. You can get svgs for any color scheme by running `generate.py`.

For most purposes, I would recommend the **ying** color scheme, as it has the best contrast for most use cases, but the others are left in for variety and demonstration of what you can do with custom colors :>

Yinglets are the creation of [Valsalia](https://www.valsalia.com/)

The wonderful [dragn emote set](https://github.com/chr-1x/dragn-emoji) was made by khr

Neofoxes and Neocats are the creations of [Volpeon](https://volpeon.ink/emojis/)

The :ms_robot: emoji is from the [Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech/) emote set

## Custom Colors
The script `generate.py` is used to generate all the different colour palettes and file types and zip files, and by adding your own colours to the dictionary inside called `palette` and running it, you can export your own custom emote set. To run it you will need some version of Python and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) but i thiiiiink thats it. hopefully. This script can also be modified to export emotes at any resolution you need.

the code is so bad but hopefully in a way thats understandable at least, lol
