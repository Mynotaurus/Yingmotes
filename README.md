# Yingmotes
A customisable yinglet emote pack!
> images will go here soon :>

Each color scheme has .svg files, .png files at 128px and 720px, and pre-zipped folders for each png format.

## Custom Colors
The script `generate.py` is used to generate all the different colour palettes and file types and zip files, and by adding your own colours to the dictionary inside called `palette` and running it, you can export your own custom emote set. To run it you will need some version of Python and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) but i thiiiiink thats it. hopefully. This script can also be modified to export emotes at any resolution you need.

the code is so bad but hopefully in a way thats understandable at least, lol
