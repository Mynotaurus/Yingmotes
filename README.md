The repo only has svgs for the ying color scheme, but all color schemes have zipped pngs in the [Releases](https://github.com/Mynotaurus/Yingmotes/releases) section. You can get svgs for any color scheme by running `generate.py`.

For most purposes, I would recommend the **ying** color scheme, as it has the best contrast for most use cases, but the others are left in for variety and demonstration of what you can do with custom colors :>

Yinglets are the creation of [Valsalia](https://www.valsalia.com/)

The wonderful [dragn emote set](https://github.com/chr-1x/dragn-emoji) was made by khr

Neofoxes and Neocats are the creations of [Volpeon](https://volpeon.ink/emojis/)

The :ms_robot: emoji is from the [Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech/) emote set

## Custom Colors
The script `generate.py` is used to generate all the different colour palettes and file types and zip files, and by adding your own colours to the dictionary inside called `palette` and running it, you can export your own custom emote set. To run it you will need some version of Python, [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and the libraries in `requirements.txt` but i thiiiiink thats it. hopefully.

running it as `python generate.py palette1 palette2 ...` will only export specific palettes, and `python generate.py emote1.svg emote2.svg ...` will only export specific emotes, these can be mixed and matched to export specific emotes in specific palettes eg `python generate.py yinglime ying_sit.svg`

Changing the array `res` allows you to set any number of custom export resolutions you may need.
Setting the variable `reverse` to True will generate flipped versions of each emote as well, stored in a seperate /reversed/ folder for each palette.

the code is so bad but hopefully in a way thats understandable at least, lol
